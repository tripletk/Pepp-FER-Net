# Pepp-FER-Net

There are two files missing from this repo, training.csv and test.csv.
training.csv goes in input/training.
test.csv goes in input/test.

Source:

- training.csv = https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data?select=training.zip
- test.csv = https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data?select=test.zip

I have run this jupyiter notebbok on my local machine w/ GPU but you can run this on colab (Probably the easier way). There are two files to note. face_key_detection_submission.csv is the output data. Each RowId in that file corresponds on the location column in SampleSubmission.csv.

### To Do
- [x] Run and Train model
- [ ] Add in explanation for each cell in Jupyter notebook
- [ ] Figure out output and how it can be applied to our own project
